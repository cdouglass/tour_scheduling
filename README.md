# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

## Design decisions

* Storing `start_time` as an integer, rather than datetime. As well as matching desired input format, storing an integer requires only half as much space as storing a datetime.
